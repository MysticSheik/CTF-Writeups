## WEB250 - Santa's Letter (RCE)
When posting a file, we can see a GET parameter called *inc* in the URL. By changing from *inc=send* to:
```
inc=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
```
We get the index.php file encoded in base64. Decoding it shows the source code of the file, including a flag.
