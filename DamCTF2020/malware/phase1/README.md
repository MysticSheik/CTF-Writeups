## malware/phase1
>Welcome to the malware challenge! There are 5 phases in the scenario, can you solve them all?
After each phase gets one solve, we will release the next phase. Although they will be available to solve in any order after released, we strongly recommend going in order.

>Scenario:
As a part of your daily work at IcyRetina (one of the world's most premier cybersecurity companies), you're always finding interesting malware and exploits in client environments. Today, you're triaging an alert for some traffic at a client site that triggered one of your Snort rules (called CLEARTEXT_ELF_LIB). Can you find something suspicious in the PCAP?

>The flag for this challenge is the lowercase SHA-256 hash of the suspicious file, wrapped in dam{...}

* Open PCAP file in Wireshark
* Filter for ELF headers: "tcp.payload contains 7f:45:4c:46"
* Follow TCP Stream on the SMTP packet
* Dump whole stream (as raw binary) to file binary.out
* Run binwalk -e binary.out in bash to extract file called 116.elf
* Run sha256sum 116.elf in bash

Flag: `dam{fc5333c5d1de963b52e57c512e10cf0e37153ac917b7040cf5f95a628a601b10}`
